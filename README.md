# React tutorial project 6 results - ReactFacts Revisited

This is the result of following a tutorial from freeCodeCamp.org on youtube. [Link to video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMknfKXIFA8&t=12s&ab_channel=freeCodeCamp.org)

This is a static webpage made using ReactJs. The purpose of this was to learn about React components and to practice simple html and styling with css.

This is an upgrade based on the first project with ReactFacts where a toggle is added to switch between light or dark mode. The purpose of this was to implement use states and conditional rendering into the project, putting some of the things learnt from project 5 into practice.

A preview of the page is shown below.
